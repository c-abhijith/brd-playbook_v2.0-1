<!-- Default Functional BRD template (playbook 2.0). Fill every section completely from the approved phases; never shorten lists.
Every statement carries its label ([[Confirmed]] / [[From evidence]] / [[Inferred]] / [[Conflicting]]) and source. Current state only.
Write long sections in batches. Remove these instruction comments as sections are filled. -->

## 6. Business rules and calculations
One entry per rule, grouped by process:
```
BR-21 · Tier threshold · [[Confirmed]] by <name>, <date>
Rule: Customers buying 5,000 units or more in a month earn the tier-2 rebate rate.
Condition and values: units in the month >= 5,000 → tier 2; otherwise tier 1
Worked example: 5,240 units × 3.5% tier-2 rate on €48,200 = €1,687
Exceptions: credit notes are subtracted before the tier is decided (BR-22)
Source: procedure step (→ Technical BRD 8.1), Rebate guide §2.3, data check LQ-0031
