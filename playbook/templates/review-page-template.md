- Plain English. Every statement: label ([[Confirmed]] / [[From evidence]] / [[Inferred]] / [[Conflicting]]),
  state tag where relevant ([[Current state]] / [[Future state]] / [[State unclear]]), and its source (EV / OBJ / LQ id, or who confirmed).
- Least certain first.
- Items needing an answer: ### heading starting with an id (Q-, CLM-, PUR-, STU-, FS-, OBJ-, GAP-, GQ-, WI-, BR-, CD-, EXT-, REL-, R-, ASM-, ITEM-).
  Each gets Agree / Correct it, a text box and an "Answered by" field.
- Blocks: ```figures (Value | label), ```flow (Step | detail), ```layers (Name | note | part, part)
- Callouts: > [!NOTE] > [!DECISION] > [!RISK] > [!PROVISIONAL] > [!CONFIRMED]
