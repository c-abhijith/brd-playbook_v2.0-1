<!-- Default Summary BRD template (playbook 2.0). Built ONLY from the approved Functional and Technical BRDs at the versions in based_on.
Every statement points to the sections it summarises (→ F 6.2, T 8.1) and keeps its label. About 3–6 pages, complete enough
for a decision maker to understand the area, its risks and what is still open without reading the other two documents. -->

## 1. At a glance
